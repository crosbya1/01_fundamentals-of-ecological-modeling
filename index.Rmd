# What is Ecology? 

## Very often, it is the study of of the distribution and abundance of plants and animals  

## I would say, the study of the ***spatio-temporal variability*** in the distribution and abundance of plant and animals

* ### How many are there? 
* ### How are they distributed? 
* ### ***Why*** do we see this particular pattern? 

???
Ecology is the study of the relationships among living organisms and the physical environment. These interactions can include:

Habitat selection
Predator-prey dynamics
Trophic cascades
Disturbance and succession dynamics...
Ecologists study Ecology (duh!)

One of the dominant branches of ecology is: the study of spatio-temporal variability in the distrubution and abundance of species (Krebs 2003].

Many research questions involve asking:

How many are there?
Where are they?
Why do we see this particular pattern? 

Don't forget about the importance of time, e.g.:
* There are more this year then last year 

* They are here in the fall but not the winter

# Modeling as a Way of Doing Science  

## Science is a process for learning about nature in which competing ideas about how the world works are measured against observations (Feynman 1965, 1985)  

## Classical statistics are built on certain assumptions:  

* ### Experimental conditions

* ### Statistical hypothesis testing 

## Often referred to as 'design-based inference' See: [Gregoire (1998)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/x98-166)

???
Replication where a single factor is manipulated while everything else is controlled 

Statistical Hypothesis testing: normally distributed errors, iid,

# Why used models (instead of experiments): [Hilboun and Mangel Ch. 1](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691034973/the-ecological-detective)

* ## Long time scales 

* ## Poor replication  

* ## Inability to control 

## Use observations, rather than experiments, to assess support for hypotheses  
## Challenge is in generating system dynamics ([MacKenzie et al. 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780124071971/occupancy-estimation-and-modeling#book-description))

Long time scales: Many ecological systems have time scales of years or decades

Many ecological systems are difficult to replicate, and replicates are rarely, if ever, perfect 

One can rarely, if ever, control all aspects of an ecological experiment 
Model-based inference: see Gregoirs (1998)
